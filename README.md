# Yew charting library

yew-chart is a collection of components that can be assembled to form charts
for the [Yew framework](https://github.com/yewstack/yew).

Here is a soil moisture/rainfall chart that has been produced using this library:

![Moisture/rainfall chart](./rainfall-moisture-chart.png "Soil moisture/rainfall chart")

By leveraging these SVG-based components many types of charts can be formed
with a great deal of flexibility. The library is intended as a toolkit that
provides conveniences for rendering chart primitives. These primitives can
be regarded at a similar level as SVG's primitives i.e. lines, polygons etc.

Here is a very basic chart produced by the examples/basic project:

...and here's the essence of the Yew view method code that was used to generate it:

```rust
fn view(&self) -> yew::Html {
    html! {
        <svg class="chart" viewBox=format!("0 0 {} {}", WIDTH, HEIGHT) preserveAspectRatio="none">
            <HorizontalSeries
                series_type=horizontal_series::SeriesType::Line
                name="some-series"
                data=Rc::clone(&self.data_set)
                data_labels=Some(Rc::clone(&self.data_set_labels))
                horizontal_scale=self.time.start.timestamp() as f32..self.time.end.timestamp() as f32
                horizontal_scale_step=Duration::days(1).num_seconds() as f32
                vertical_scale=0.0..5.0
                x=MARGIN y=MARGIN width={WIDTH - (MARGIN * 2)} height={HEIGHT - (MARGIN * 2)} />

            <VerticalAxis
                name="some-y-axis"
                orientation=vertical_axis::Orientation::Left
                scale=0.0..5.0 scale_step=0.5
                x1=MARGIN y1=MARGIN y2={HEIGHT - MARGIN}
                tick_len=TICK_LENGTH
                title="Some Y thing".to_string() />

            <HorizontalTimeAxis
                time=self.time.to_owned() time_step=Duration::days(1)
                x1=MARGIN y1={HEIGHT - MARGIN} x2={WIDTH - MARGIN}
                tick_len=TICK_LENGTH />

        </svg>
    }
}
```
