# Yew charting library

yew-chart is a collection of components that can be assembled to form charts
for the [Yew framework](https://github.com/yewstack/yew).

Here is a soil moisture/rainfall chart that has been produced using this library:

By leveraging these SVG-based components many types of charts can be formed
with a great deal of flexibility. The library is intended as a toolkit that
provides conveniences for rendering chart primitives. These primitives can
be regarded at a similar level as SVG's primitives i.e. lines, polygons etc.

Here is a very basic chart produced by the examples/basic project:
